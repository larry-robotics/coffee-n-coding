## About

I started learning Rust in 2021 and use it in nearly every private project while
my professional life still consists purely of C++. The way of thinking about
ownership and the idioms in Rust helped me to become a better C++ developer.

With this blog, I try to pursue three goals:

 1. To grasp all the little details by writing about topics that fascinate me.
 2. Let other profits from the experience and knowledge I gained.
 3. Become a better technical writer, so hints on how to illustrate a topic better
    are highly welcome.

So this blog shall be a bridge between C++ and Rust developers, to understand
the concepts of the other side better and maybe incorporate enrich existing
concepts with new ones.
